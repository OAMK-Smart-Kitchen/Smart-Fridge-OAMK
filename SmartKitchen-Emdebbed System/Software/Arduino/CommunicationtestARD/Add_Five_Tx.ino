/*            Transmitter

 This sketch makes use of Serial1. This functionality is only found on the Arduino Mega and other 3rd party boards.
 Tx1: pin 18   Rx1: pin 19
 Connect the Tx1->Rx  and Rx1 ->Tx pins with the board running Add_Five_Rx.ino
 Connect the Grounds of the two boards
 
 Read integer value from Serial Monitor
 Transmit that value to the Rx board
 Receive integer from Rx and print to Serial Monitor
 
 Note: The Tx and Rx boards are just names I chose. The communication is 2-way. 
 Master-slave would probably be a better option.
